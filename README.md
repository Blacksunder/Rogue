# Rogue
Rogue like game with a console interface, is developed using MVC pattern

It includes:
- game logic (creatures, items, map generating);
- datasource module for saving/loading last game and records in json files;
- presentation layout with a console interface.

This is a team-project, my part - all map's and datasource's processing.
